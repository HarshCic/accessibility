***Top-down development:***

It is widely acknowledged that the most efficient way, of developing professional and enterprise-level software projects, is by the top-down method. This involves first writing documentation of the project overview, followed by documentation of details of the various sub-projects.

The details can, then, be allocated to team members, who able to code. They can, write further, more finely-tuned documentation and, also, to begin to write the actual code for their sub-project.

Finally, the code can, collaboratively, be tested, tweaked and debugged, until it is ready for public release, in the normal versioned manner.

No branch of this project need grow at the same rate as any other and all team members are encouraged to contribute cross sub-projects, in any way in which they are able to give useful feedback, at all times. There is no prize for speed but their may be praise for accurate and efficient work, because it will progress our work and make it of high quality.

In this way, consensuses can be reached, through direct feedback, compromise agreements and goodwill, as an ongoing process. Fewer mistakes may be made; less duplication of work, less code dumped, arguments escalate less often and the entire process become far smoother.
