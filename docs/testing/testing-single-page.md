# A single page accessibility test
The following is an example of a single page accessibility test sequence that can be used as a starting point for evaluation.

## Test 1. HTML Code validation

**Use the Nu Html Checker Validator (experimental).**

Does the validator report errors and warnings? [(4.1.1 Parsing - Level A)][1]

If the validator reports errors, write them down in the report.

If you recognize important comments, please report them in the report.

[Read the article on html validation.][2]

## Test 2. Automatic

**Execute one of the automated tests**. 

You can use browser add-ons, such as WAVE, AXE, OpenWAX, Accessibility Developer Toolbar or the selected web service.
