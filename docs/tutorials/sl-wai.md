# Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)

The Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) is an initiative of the World Wide Web Consortium launched in 1997 with endorsement by The White House and W3C members to help make the internet more accessible to people with disabilities. The WAI applies to all types of disabled populations, including the growing elderly population. Equal opportunity and equal access rights are the crux of the WAI.

The WAI seeks to make the internet more accessible to people with auditory, cognitive, neurological, physical, speech and visual impairments. This is largely accomplished through what the organization calls "inclusive design."

WAI pursues accessibility of the web through five primary activities:

* **Technology** - ensuring those core technologies of the Web support accessibility
* **Guidelines** - developing guidelines for Web content, user agents, and authoring tools
* **Tools** - facilitating development of evaluation and repair tools for accessibility
* **Education** - conducting education and outreach 
* **Research and development** - coordinating with researchers and developers 

The second of these activities (developing guidelines) has yielded the following sets of W3C Recommendations (official guidelines) to date:

* [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 (WCAG 2.0)][1] - refers to content on web pages.
* [Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 (ATAG 2.0)][2] - refers to software for creating web pages.
* [User Agent Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 (UAAG 2.0)][3] - refers to web browsers
* [Accessible Rich Internet Applications 1.1 (WAI-ARIA 1.1)][4]
