# Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines 2.0

The **Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) 2.0** is a technical standard designed by the W3C to support developers in the creation of authoring tools. Authoring tools are software and services that "authors" (web developers, designers, writers, etc.) use to produce web content. ATAG is primarily for developers of authoring tools, including among others software for generating websites, for example, content management systems.


The current ATAG 2.0 release is in its final draft. It is the current standard and is split into two parts:

## What is in ATAG 2.0
* **Part A**: Make the authoring tool user interface accessible; and
* **Part B**: Support the production of accessible content.

The **Part A** guidelines focuses on ensuring that people with disabilities are able to effectively use an authoring tool and are as follows:

* **Principle A.1**: Authoring tool user interfaces must follow applicable accessibility guidelines
* **Principle A.2**: Editing views must be perceivable
* **Principle A.3**: Editing views must be operable
* **Principle A.4**: Editing views must be understandable

The **Part B** focuses on ensuring that content or applications created by an authoring tool meet accessibility standards and incorporate accessibility features. They are as follows:

* **Principle B.1**: Production of accessible content must be enabled
* **Principle B.2**: Authors must be supported in the production of accessible content
* **Principle B.3**: Accessibility solutions must be promoted and integrated
* **Principle B.4**: Authoring tools must promote and integrate their accessibility features


## Who ATAG is for
ATAG is primarily for developers of authoring tools, including the following types of authoring tools:

* Web page authoring tools, for example, what-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWYG) HTML editors
* Software for generating websites, for example, content management systems (CMS), courseware tools, content aggregators
* Software that converts to web content technologies, for example, word processors and other office document applications with "Save as HTML"
* Multimedia authoring tools
* Websites that let users add content, such as blogs, wikis, photo sharing sites, online forums, and social networking sites
* Other types of tools listed in the glossary definition of authoring tools.

ATAG and supporting resources are also intended to meet the needs of many different audiences, including policy makers, managers, and others. For example:

* People who want to choose authoring tools that are accessible and that produce accessible content can use ATAG to evaluate authoring tools.
* People who want to encourage their existing authoring tool developer to improve accessibility in future versions can refer the authoring tool vendor to ATAG.
