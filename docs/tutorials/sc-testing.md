# Screenreader testing
Checking a website with a screen reader is an invaluable way to make sure that a website is functionally accessible. 
* **Windows users** can use the free [NVDA screen reader](https://www.nvaccess.org/).
* **Mac users** can use the native [Voiceover screen reader](https://help.apple.com/voiceover/info/guide/10.12/?lang=en) utility. 
* **Linux users** can use the [screen reader Orca](https://help.gnome.org/users/orca/stable/). 

All are free and have a low learning curve. 

Instead of a screen reader, you can use [ChromoVox for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chromevox/kgejglhpjiefppelpmljglcjbhoiplfn). It is a highly effective tool for developers when testing Web content.
