# How to write a Joomla UI component specification?
**Instructions for the author of the specification**

1. Read the existing UI component specifications, including:
- [WAI-ARIA practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1)
- [U.S. Web Design Standards](https://standards.usa.gov/components/)
- [EBay MIND Patterns](https://ebay.gitbooks.io/mindpatterns/content/)
- [jQuery API documentation -> Widgets](http://api.jqueryui.com/category/widgets/)
- [USPTO UI Design Library](http://uspto.github.io/designpatterns/1.x/docs/index.html)
- [The A11Y Project](http://a11yproject.com/patterns.html)
- [AccDC Technical Style Guide](http://whatsock.com/tsg/)
- [Code Library (Beta) by Deque](https://dequeuniversity.com/library/)
- [Accessible solution by Adina](http://haltersweb.github.io/Accessibility/)
   
   **Note**:
   You can complete this list, if you find, here, a specification that is not mentioned, here.
   Not all of these specifications describe all of our components

2. Use the Google search to find the articles for the UI component for which you want to prepare the specification. Check out these articles. Pay attention to the opinions of good practice authors.
3. Open the specification template or draft document into this folder.
4. Compile the specification content. Pay attention when copying, to avoid unnecessary content, references, comments. Try to customize the document style, to the style used in the specifications that you have already developed.
5. Remember to indicate in references all sources (links) that you have used in the preparation of the material.
